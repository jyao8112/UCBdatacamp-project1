Team, we are trying to look in to important factors to make people feel happy in their life! Let's dig into some data and see whether we can predict how to make a happy life!

Now we got happiness ranking in the world, based on these dataset,  We are going to search in to different fields to see the what will contribute to the happiness. 

These fields are:
1, Healthcare or Medicalcare related (Jinghua)
2, Education related (David)
3, Finance/Economics related (Junlin)
4, HighTech related (Matt/Danny)

Everyone will need to figure out how to acess to their own data, and do data analysis to find relationship to the happiness ranking countries. You own data and figures will be used as your own presentation(about 2-3 min).

I have combined the orignal datasets of the happniess (2015/2016/2017.csv) and re-rank the countries by adding the average Happinese Score. The final data is saved as World_Happiness_Ranking.

Please use that as a start to work on your own data set and try to get information to see whether you can answer thess questions:
(1) Do you think [your filed] will contribute to the happiness to the country and why.
(2) What make the most happiness and what make the most un-happiness in your filed.
(2) Can you predict the more invest in your filed will make people more happy?
